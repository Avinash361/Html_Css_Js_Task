                    <p> In order to write, one must read constantly, observe the world well, and take seriously the
                        craft of writing. During this five-week course, we will focus on the last of these, the craft of
                        writing—specifically, we will focus on three mainstays of fiction: character, dialogue, and
                        scene.

                        “I think that writers often feel more comfortable writing exposition and summary than scene,
                        perhaps because in our own lives we often feel more comfortable observing than engaging, and
                        scene is about getting our characters to engage,” says instructor Lori Ostlund. “In this class
                        we will focus on creating scenes as a way to develop characters, demonstrate changes in them,
                        and increase tension.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We will also spend a lot of time on dialogue, thinking about it as a way to reveal character
                        and
                        relationships and, perhaps most important, as a way to reveal the shifting power dynamics that
                        are at work in those relationships and which create tension.”
